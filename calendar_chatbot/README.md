# Calendar ChatBot

## FUCTION
*Streamlit api is very touchy so to run the program I have used both:
'python -m streamlit run "File Location" ' and,
'py -m streamlit run "File Location" '*

## SHORT DESCRIPTION
*Take a day, month input and grabs all holiday data from calendarific api using requests. The data is then parsed with chatGPT and returned to the user*

## REFERENCES
*Streamlit API Docs, OpenAI API Docs, Calendarific API docs, StackOverflow for being the goat of troubleshooting*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS
*Need a calendarific api key (free upon signing up through a simple process) and an openai api key (paid). Please email me if you need either of these.

# ADHD ChatBot

## FUCTION
*Streamlit api is very touchy so to run the program I have used both:*
*'python -m streamlit run "File Location" ' and,*
*'py -m streamlit run "File Location" '*

## SHORT DESCRIPTION
*A chatGPT clone that was trained and specified upon how to respond to a user about adhd. Allows for trilingual support*

## REFERENCES
*Streamlit API Docs, OpenAI API Docs, StackOverflow for being the goat of troubleshooting.*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS
*Need an openai api key (paid). Please email me if you need assistance with this.*
